Maff:: Perl module namespace - various things I write during my quest to abuse perl.
Currently the following namespaces exist within Maff:
Maff::Common - Modules containing shared subroutines and other reusables
Maff::Utils - Namespace used by utilities I write

Under Maff::Common, the following modules currently exist:
Maff::Common::IO - helper subroutines and other IO-related code
Maff::Common::Net - various wrappers and subroutines for network-related code
Maff::Common::OSX - various wrappers and subroutines for working with the darwin platform

The following modules under Maff::Common are planned at some point but presently do not exist in any meaningful form:
Maff::Common::System - subroutines and such for working with log files, processes, forking, exec-ing and whatnot
